            6 years ago with my family and I really enjoy it here. My hobbies is reading books and I 
           enjoy playing football. Besides that glade to be here to inhance my learning carrer.
           In addittion to all that I really care about my growth in every area of my life such as 
           Spiritual, physical and social which I have and always been working on everday of my life
           as I also try to balance between all of them which was a bit of challeng but accepted the fact 
           that nothing such as hard if we don't try our best and eventually becomes a habit to do. </p>
